# drone-greenfollow

This was the fruit of our efforts on the Nodecopter Brighton hackday.  
  
The plan was to get the AR Copter to recognise my green T-shirt and then navigate toward me, however we had a bug in our image processing code and unfortunately it didn't get off the ground (pun intended).  
  
Feel free to fork/modify/laugh at as you see fit.
